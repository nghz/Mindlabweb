  Advanced Numerical Modeling of Fracture Mechanisms in Lithium-Ion Batteries During Charge/Discharge Cycles: Implementation Using FEniCS
abstract: >
  To gain a deeper understanding of the structural reliability of lithium-ion battery electrodes and the nucleation and propagation of cracks during charge and discharge cycles, it is essential to enhance our knowledge of the degradation mechanisms affecting electrode particles. In this presentation, we introduce a rigorous mathematical formulation for the fatigue failure theory in lithium-ion battery electrode particles, specifically addressing lithium diffusion-induced fracture. Predicting fatigue cracking during the charge andescriptiond discharge cycles of lithium-ion batteries is a complex and critical task, pivotal for various electronic applications. To simulate fatigue cracking, we employ the phase-field approach, a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing fracture phenomena in solids. Our primary objective is to describe a variationally consistent energetic formulation based on incremental energy minimization for gradient-extended dissipative solids. This formulation results in a coupled system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern the gradient-extended elastic-chemo damage response. Given that the damage mechanisms in lithium-ion battery electrode particles are due to swelling and shrinkage effects, we perform an additive decomposition of the strain tensor. The developed chemo-mechanical model is implemented in FEniCS, a popular open-source computing platform for solving PDEs, which facilitates the implementation of parallel finite element method (FEM) simulations. Several numerical simulations with different case studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of our algorithmic developments.
