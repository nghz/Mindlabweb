  PRACTICAL WORKSHOP-Getting Started with PyTorch and PINNS-SESSION 2

abstract: >
  This worksop will cover the essentials of PyTorch, including setting up your environment, defining neural network architectures, and implementing a Physics- Informed Neural Network (PINN) model. Participants will engage in practical exercises to solidify their understanding and gain confidence in using PyTorch for machine learning and scientific computing. No prior experience with PINNs is required, but a basic understanding of Python and neural networks will be beneficial.
