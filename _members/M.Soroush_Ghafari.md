M. Soroush Ghafari graduated with a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics, specializing in solving equations related to fluid dynamics using numerical methods. His thesis focused on the simulation and numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equation using local meshless methods. He has a strong interest in fluid dynamics, particularly in the context of climate change and geophysics. Ghafari is proficient in programming languages such as MATLAB and Python. He is currently exploring integrating numerical methods with machine learning and data science to develop more accurate models for fluid dynamics.
