Reza Masoumzadeh is a Master's graduate in Numerical Analysis from Amirkabir University of Technology. He is a Bachelor's graduate in Mathematics and Applications from Isfahan University of Technology. His Master's thesis was dedicated to the simulation of two-phase flows based on the incompressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations using the isogeometric analysis (IGA) method. Accordingly, his research primarily focuses on numerical methods for solving partial differential equations. Masoumzadeh is interested in researching and working in the fields of machine learning and data mining, especially for combining such algorithms with numerical methods. Reza is proficient in programming with MATLAB, Maple and Python.
