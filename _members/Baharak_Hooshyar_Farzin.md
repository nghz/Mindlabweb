Baharak Hooshyar Farzin is a Ph.D. student at Amirkabir University of Technology. Her research focuses on enhanced finite element methods for the numerical solutions of partial differential equations. She holds her Master's degree from Amirkabir University of Technology. Her Master's thesis was dedicated to the proper orthogonal decomposition idea and finite element method for numerical solution of the solute transport equation. She is interested in developing numerical approaches based on weak Galerkin finite, isoparametric, and virtual element methods to solve practical engineering problems.
